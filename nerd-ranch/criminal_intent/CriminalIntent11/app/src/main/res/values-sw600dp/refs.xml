    The -sw600dp configuration qualifier lets you provide resources
    only when a device is above a certain size. The sw stands for “smallest width,”
    but refers to the screen’s smallest dimension, and thus is independent of the
    device’s current orientation. With a -sw600dp qualifier, you are saying,
    “Use this resource on any device whose smallest dimension is 600dp or greater.”
